# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains the input and my python solution files for 2023's Advent of Code challenges. I celebrated Christmas in February, two months after the challenges were released - but hey, better late than never to help the elves get presents out to the kiddos.

Where I had major help from outside sources, I've made note in the python file. Otherwise, all solutions are my own approach.
